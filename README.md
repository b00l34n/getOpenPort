# getOpenPort

this is a little python-skript with a shell-skript as starter to show all open tcp and udp ports
with the PID and Name of the Software, the port belongs to.
It uses the bsd version of "netstat" for the general information, and the python-skript to format
the output nicely. I recomend using python 3.7.3, because it's what i used to "develop" the skript

If you have any recomandations on how to improve this project or how to improve my code quality in 
general, please let me know.
I am more then happy to resive some tipps form pros!
